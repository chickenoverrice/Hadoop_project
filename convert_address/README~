Property addresses from Walkscore and Zillow are different from other data sources. Therefore the purpose of this data cleaning step is to converting these addresses into a uniform format. 

Please find sample data in the folder 'sample_data'.
For Walkscore data and materials, please find them in 'ReplaceWalkAddr' folder.
For Zillow data and materials, please find them in 'ReplaceWalkZillow' folder.

The cleaning steps are as following:

1. The addresses from raw data are extracted using a pig program called 'extractAddrWalk.pig' or 'extractAddrZillow.pig'. The result 'part-m-00000' is saved in 'walk' or 'zillow' folder.

2. The result from step1 is used as input for a mapreduce job called 'convertAddress.java', which is universal for Walkscore and Zillow data. This program converts these raw addresses into the same format. The result is saved in 'out' folder.

3. The addresses in raw data are replaced by the new addresses using a pig program called 'replaceAddrWalk.pig' or 'replaceAddrZillow.pig'. The result is save in 'walk_new' or 'zillow_new' folder.
